/**
 * 
 * The scope of this use case is to investigate the operability of
 * DeciBell&copy; in cases where some entity has self References. Self-references,
 * are foreign keys, that point to the same entity that holds them. A prime example
 * for such a case, is User which has a friend-user (which is also a user). The same
 * pattern is met in databases storing exceptional events and traces of errors where
 * an Error has a cause (which is some other error bock to an error with no trace).
